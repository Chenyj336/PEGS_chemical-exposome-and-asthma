## Abstract
- **Background**: Employed an exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) approach to systematically explore occupational chemical exposures and estimate their combined risk for adult asthma. 

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional study included 3148 adults from a North Carolina-based cohort _PEGS. Logistic regression-based ExWAS analyzed associations for individual chemicals. Weighted standardized polyexposure scores (PXSs) were further developed for predefined known asthmagens (PXS known) and suspected or novel risk agents (PXS suspected or novel), selected through a LASSO regression.

- **Results**: In ExWAS analysis, ever exposure to cleaning liquids, heavy metals, dust, and combustion emissions, was positively associated with asthma (FDR< 0.05). The top five specific risk chemical agents were talc, ammonia, bleach, silica, and carbon monoxide. PXS known (four agents) and PXS suspected or novel (six agents) showed positive associations with asthma and multimorbidity. Additionally, participants using gloves and protective clothing had reduced risks of asthma and respiratory multimorbidity in relation to PXS suspected or novel (P interaction< 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: This data-driven study identified six potential suspected and novel risk chemical agents not clinically recognized as occupational asthmagens. PXS can summarize joint exposures and their effects on asthma and respiratory multimorbidity, supporting occupational risk assessment in clinical and public health settings.
